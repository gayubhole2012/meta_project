          <p>
            Gold, just the word brings to mind value, rarity, wealth, beauty and
            jewelry. But what is gold? Yes the scientists tell us gold is an
            element with the chemical symbol Au. We know it is the heraldic
            metal and it is a rare yellow mineral that is the most malleable and
            pliable of all metals. Yes, but what does that mean to me? Gold is a
            beautiful metal that is used to make timeless jewelry. Gold can be
            bent and molded into elegant engagement rings to show the eternal
            affection of one person to another. Gold is an expression of love.
